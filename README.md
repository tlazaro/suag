Experiments with Attribute Grammars and Parser Combinators.

The current code is based on slides presented by [Doaitse Swierstra](http://www.cs.uu.nl/staff/doaitse.html) in one week course presented at Facultad de Ingeniería del Uruguay. The topic was Advanced Functional Programming. The content went from Parser Combinators to Lazyness to Attribute Grammars. That work is consolidated in the libraries [uu-parsinglib](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uu-parsinglib-2.7.4) and [uuagc](http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/HUT/AttributeGrammarSystem).

The course presented all the code in Haskell. This project attempts to convert it to Scala while preserving the original expressiveness. This is not a library and might never be useful as such. Consider this a research.

All the code here was written in collaboration by [Tomás Lázaro](https://github.com/tlazaro) and [Rodrigo Cano](https://github.com/rcano).
